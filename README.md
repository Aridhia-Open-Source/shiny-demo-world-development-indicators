# WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS

**World Development Indicators** is the World Bank's premier compilation of cross-country comparable data on development. They are a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. 

The database contains 1,400 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 60 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years. The main topics covered in the data are:

- **Poverty and inequality** (poverty, prosperity, consumption, income distribution...)
- **People** (people dynamics, education, labor, health, gender...)
- **Environment** (agriculture, climate change, energy, biodiversity, water, sanitation...)
- **Economy** (growth, economic structure, income and savings, trade, labour productivity...)
- **States and Markets** (business, stock markets, military, communications, transport, technology)
- **Global Links** (debt, trade, aid dependency, refugee, tourism, migration)

The database for the world development indicators can be found here: https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/
